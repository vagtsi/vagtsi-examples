# Eclipse SWT Examples

Some small examples used for as playground for an real application in a former project. Can be used as starting point for own SWT UI applications easily.

Each example class has a main function and thus can be started directly as java application from within the IDE.

The SWT dependencies are solved via maven for Windows and Linux (both AMD 64bit) based systems.
