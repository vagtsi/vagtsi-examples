This (java) source project contains my tiny example programs developed during leisure time having one idea in common: get the smallest runnable program for a technical problem.
Since all projects a build with [Maven](http://maven.apache.org), they should be easily compilable on you computer as well.

All projects require:
  * [Eclipse IDE](http://eclipse.org) (I currently use version 4.2.2)
  * with installed [M2E plugin](http://eclipse.org/m2e)
  * [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) of course (I use version 3.0.5)
  * if a application server runtime is required, I usually prefer [Virgo Tomcat Server](http://www.eclipse.org/virgo)
